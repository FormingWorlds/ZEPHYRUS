TITLE: The active lives of stars: a complete description of rotation and XUV evolution for F, G, K, and M dwarfs
AUTHORS: Johnstone, C. P., Bartel, M., Guedel, M.
DESCRIPTION: Rotaton and XUV evolution track

The directories hold the following:-
  
TrackGrid_MstarOmega0/ - This holds a grid of evolutionary tracks for different stellar masses and initial rotation rates.For example, a file with a name starting with "0p1Msun_0p1OmegaSun" holds the track for a 0.1 Msun star with an initial rotation rate of 0.1 OmegaSun (defined as 2.67e-6 rad/s). The rest of the filename is either "_basic.dat" for files holding the basic rotation, Lx, and Leuv tracks, and "_extended.dat" for files holding more detailed information. 
  
TrackGrid_MstarPercentile/ - This holds a grid of evolutionary tracks for different stellar masses and percentiles in the rotation distribution. The filenames in this directory give the stellar mass and percentile of the 150 Myr rotation distribution. For example, a filename starting with "0p1Msun_2percentile_basic" holds the track for a 0.1 Msun star at the 2nd percentile. The rest of the filename is either "_basic.dat" for files holding the basic rotation, Lx, and Leuv tracks, and "_extended.dat" for files holding more detailed information. 
  
TrackGrid_Distribution/ - This holds a grid of evolutionary tracks for each of the stars in the model distribution shown in the paper (e.g. blue in Fig. 2).
